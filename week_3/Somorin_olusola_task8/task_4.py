# Student Record
# Create an empty dictionary called student.
# Ask the user to input their name and age, then store them in the dictionary.
# Add a list of scores(e.g.,[70,85,90]) to the dictionary.
# Use a comparison operator to check if the student has passed (average score >= 50). Save the result (True/False) in the dictionary under the key "passed".
# Use a logical operator to check if the student is a teenager (age between 13 and 19). Save the result as "teenager". 
# Print out the complete record.
